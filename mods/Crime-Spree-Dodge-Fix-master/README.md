# Crime-Spree-Dodge-Fix

This mod for Payday 2 disables the concealment penalty option in Crime Sprees, since it affects both stealth and loud (despite saying it should only affect stealth).  With this disabled, longer crime sprees no longer force dodge builds to be sub optimal.

Mod is installed like any other Payday 2 mod, and requires BLT.  Mod must be on the host of a Crime Spree in order to work, and has not been tested with existing Crime Sprees (I'd recommend ending your current Crime Spree before installing this mod).
